Hi Guys,


This is my first contribution to open source community. 

It's an iPhone App (Sample) of getting the screen shot of the viewController, getting it into an image and attaching the same to the MFMailComposer class to send it to anybody.


Please let me know if I need to make changes somewhere or I haven't done it properly.


Thanks and Regards
